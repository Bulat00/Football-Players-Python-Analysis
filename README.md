Hello and Welcome! 
I'm Michele, a Data Scientist and Sports Passionate.
Here is one of my main project that i would like to share with anyone.

In the .ipynb file you can find a generic template with instruction to create your Football Player Comparison Analysis
- Easy Data scraping from FBRef
- Data Cleaning thanks to Pandas Library
- Data Visualization thanks to MatplotLib and StatsBomb
- Data Analysis thanks to... Your self! Find the most useful data for your analyis.

## Gyokeres VS Nunez

Hi Everyone! (Reading Time: 3 Minutes)


‚òù I recently decided to use my free time to start some new projects that I would enjoy and improve as a programmer and analyst. Therefore, I decided to take create an easy-to-use Football Player Comparison Template.


‚ö´ If you are interested about the Python code I refer you to my github:

https://github.com/Bulat00/Football-Players-Python-Analysis


üî• The goal of the project is not mere football analysis but to demonstrate that thanks to this code it will be possible to extrapolate data and create graphs that allow us to perform analysis in less than 3 minutes. Here is an example:


‚≠ê To demonstrate Gyokeres' excessive power, he is often compared to Darwin Nunez. But are the two players really alike?


üîç An interesting statistic emerges from the analysis: Gyokeres and Nunez are two very similar players in terms of playing style: Both carry the ball a lot, especially in the final third of the field. 


‚ö° Although the two players physically and game-wise seem to resemble each other, in reality their function in the Portuguese league was completely different: Gyokeres is a goal machine, while Nunez besides scoring is a player who also helped his teammates a lot in the construction phase.
